**ABSTRACT**

This thesis work deals with the design of a grasping mechanism for
aerial grasping and assembly tasks by autonomous unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs). The proposed design is aimed at solving ferromagnetic
grasping by UAVs and has onboard sensors that detect and provide
reliable feedback to the UAV. The main focus of the work deals with
the design of the gripper, the technique used for feedback estimation and the integration of the entire mechanism into the current UAV systems at the MRS lab. Furthermore, an overview of the entire system and its implementation are discussed. The developed mechanism is tested multiple times under indoor and outdoor conditions and is designed to be deployed for Challenge II of the MBZIRC 2020 robotics competition in Abu Dhabi.
